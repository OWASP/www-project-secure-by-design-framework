## Code of Conduct

## **Review & Approval Process**

The framework follows a two-tier review:

1. Peer Review (Community)
   - Any contributor may review and comment on PRs.
   - Focus on clarity, accuracy, and alignment with SbD principles.
2. Maintainer Approval
   - Maintainers are responsible for merging changes.
   - At least two maintainer approvals are required for substantive changes.
   - Small editorial fixes (typos, formatting) may be merged with a single maintainer review.

## **Governance Model**

- **Maintainers** – Appointed from the contributor community; responsible for:
  - Reviewing and merging PRs.
  - Ensuring changes align with the framework’s scope and style.
  - Coordinating releases.
- **Community Contributors** – Anyone submitting PRs or issues; encouraged to:
  - Participate in discussions.
  - Share implementation feedback.
  - Help triage issues.
- **OWASP Liaison** – A designated contact to ensure alignment with OWASP’s overall mission and policies.
